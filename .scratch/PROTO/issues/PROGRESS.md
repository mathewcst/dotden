# PROGRESS — live build status (dotden v1)

The single source of truth for **what is done / in flight / blocked**. Agents update their issue's row
(and append a line to the Log) when they **start** and **finish**.

## How to update

- **Starting:** set Status `🟡 In progress`, put your agent id + date in *Who* / *Started*.
- **Finishing:** set Status `✅ Done`, fill *Finished* + *Branch/PR* + a one-line *Outcome*; append a **Log** entry.
- **Blocked:** set `⛔ Blocked`, note the reason + blocking issue in *Outcome*.
- An issue is **grabbable** only when every code in its *Blocked by* (see [TRACK.md](./TRACK.md)) is `✅ Done`.

Status key: `⬜ Not started` · `🟡 In progress` · `🔵 In review` · `✅ Done` · `⛔ Blocked`

## Ready now (no blockers)

## PRD 1 — MVP (the sync loop)

| Issue | Title | Type | Blocked by | Status | Who | Started | Finished | Branch/PR | Outcome |
|-------|-------|------|-----------|--------|-----|---------|----------|-----------|---------|
| `1-00` | Spike: validate @pierre/trees renderRowDecoration two-axis row geometry | HITL | — | ✅ Done | claude | 2026-06-15 | 2026-06-15 | .scratch/proto-row-decoration | GO — keep the overlay. beta.4 draws a coloured M/A/D/R/U letter; `renderRowDecoration` text lands directly left of it (`↓ M`/`⚠ U`), no overlap/clip at compact/default/relaxed. No `unsafeCSS`, no `setGitStatus` fallback. Recipe + shots in issue-00. |
| `1-01` | Faithful-wrapper foundation — ChezmoiAdapter/GitTransport + Vitest harness | AFK | — | ✅ Done | pi | 2026-06-15 | 2026-06-15 | workspace | Added Vitest harness, temp git fixture, ChezmoiAdapter/GitTransport, bundled-tool resolver, ADR 0019, and real chezmoi/git integration tests. |

| `1-03` | RemoteClient — connect existing Remote, ls-remote preflight, system git creds | AFK | — | ✅ Done | pi | 2026-06-15 | 2026-06-15 | workspace | Added RemoteClient, timeout/cancel process support, typed IPC/preload bridge, minimal Connect URL UI, and tests for preflight/init/latest SHA/no env override/sanitized diagnostics. |
| `1-04` | First end-to-end thread — Track → Commit → Sync → second-env Apply (incoming-clean) | AFK | 1-01, 1-03 | ✅ Done | workflow | 2026-06-15 | 2026-06-15 | feat/main-app | End-to-end thread real across two envs: IpcBridge (_trace on every call) + OperationTracer (allowlisted wide events, bounded ring) + SyncEngine (incoming-clean route) + ApplicabilityResolver (un-forgeable AppliesHere) + ApplyPlanner + MyenvStore (.myenv/) + 3-pane shell using @pierre/trees+@pierre/diffs. 51 tests incl.

Own id mirrored to local chezmoi `[data].dotden_env_id` (spike-proven subscription-`.chezmoiignore` seam); new-or-returning probe + claim adopt id; suggestClaims by OS+setup-hostname (no auto-merge). `env:*` IPC + editable EnvironmentBadge UI. 69 tests green. |
| `1-06` | Tool-catalog discovery scan + first-environment onboarding | AFK | 1-04 | ✅ Done | workflow | 2026-06-15 | 2026-06-15 | feat/main-app | DiscoveryScanner (catalog-grounded home-dir scan, feature-detection not sweep, ADR 0022) + `discover:*` IPC; OnboardingShell + OnboardingMenu rail + OBContent steps Welcome/CreateRepo/ConnectURL(reuses 1-03 preflight)/Discover/Commit/AutoSync(wired slot)/Done; drag-in/browse for missed Files; picks Track via 1-04 path → default Workspace auto-seeded; App routes onboarding↔Workspace. 81 tests green. |
| `1-07` | Three-pane view — tree interactions, git-status decorations, inspector, diff | AFK | 1-04 | ✅ Done | workflow | 2026-06-15 | 2026-06-15 | feat/main-app | Real three-pane wired chezmoi↔main↔IPC↔UI: `den:tree`/`den:diff` IPC over `DenService.fileTree`/`fileDiff` (managed + parsed `chezmoi status` local axis M/A/D from **column X only** — col Y is the incoming axis owned by 1-09 — + `chezmoi ignored` muted + `.myenv/` placement; per-File `chezmoi diff`). Renderer @pierre/trees with setGitStatus + search + inline rename + drag-reorganize + renderRowDecoration seam (1-09); @pierre/diffs PatchDiff of selected File; inspector FILE info. @pierre/trees beta pinned + pnpm-patched (Math.random sticky-jitter→0); Shiki trimmed to config langs via a grammar-free `shiki` shim (308→93 chunks). gpgsign-off test hygiene. 91 tests green. |
| `1-08` | Right-click row actions + Untrack + Delete everywhere | AFK | 1-07 | ✅ Done | workflow | 2026-06-15 | 2026-06-15 | feat/main-app | Right-click row menu (`@base-ui` ContextMenu over `@pierre/trees`, target via `data-item-path`) offers Commit · Apply · Untrack · Delete everywhere (latter visibly distinct: separator + red). Untrack→`forget` (File STAYS on disk everywhere, Default-tone confirm says so); Delete everywhere→`destroy` (Destructive-tone confirm NAMES every subscribed environment via `den:affected-environments`). Both commit LOCALLY (ADR 0006). **Caught+fixed a real bug**: forget/destroy *deletes* the source-state file but the commit only staged `.myenv/`, leaving the deletion unstaged → it would re-appear on Sync; switched to `commitAll` so the removal travels (proven by a cross-env clone test). +4 DenService e2e tests; 95 tests green. |

## Log (append-only, newest first)

<!-- Add one line per state change: `YYYY-MM-DD · code · status · agent · note` -->
2026-06-15 · CODE · ✅ Done · workflow · 1-14 Workspaces (access boundary, invisible until 2nd) + nested Groups: extended the synced `.myenv/` Workspace model (ADR 0024) — `Workspace` gains a flat `parentId`-linked nested `Group` tree, `FilePlacement` gains `groupId`. New `MyenvStore` ops: `createWorkspace` (mints a 2nd+ access boundary), `createGroup` (nested, refuses cross-Workspace parent), `moveFileToGroup` (the organize-ONLY move) and `setFileWorkspace` (access move, resets Group). The load-bearing invariant (ADR 0005): a Group move changes NEITHER access (`workspaceId`) NOR on-disk path (`targetPath`) — proven byte-for-byte in unit + e2e tests; `setFileWorkspace` is the contrast (access DOES change). `placeFile` now preserves a File's Group on re-Track (sticky organization); `readWorkspaces` normalizes legacy docs (no `groups`/`groupId`) so older Dens load forward-compat. New `DenService` methods commit the `.myenv/`-only edit LOCALLY (ADR 0006) so the tree travels on Sync (proven by an env-B clone test reconstructing the nested Group tree + Workspaces). `OperationKind` gains `organize`. IPC: `den:create-workspace`/`den:create-group`/`den:move-to-group`/`den:set-file-workspace` (each MUTATES so its `_trace` is forwarded), preload + contract. Renderer: new `WorkspaceSidebar` renders Workspace sections + the nested Group tree with add-Workspace/add-Group affordances, shown ONLY once a 2nd Workspace OR any Group exists (the "invisible until 2nd" rule) — until then the flat `@pierre/trees` tree stands and the concept stays hidden; `FileRow` renders grouped File rows (real status letters, `data-item-path` so the 1-08 right-click verbs still work); inspector Group selector files the selected File. 106 tests green (+11). Unblocks 1-15 (OS Scope).
2026-06-15 · CODE · ✅ Done · workflow · 1-08 right-click row verbs + Untrack + Delete everywhere: row context menu (`@base-ui` ContextMenu over the `@pierre/trees` tree; right-clicked File recovered from the row's `data-item-path`) offers Commit · Apply · Untrack · Delete everywhere — the destructive verb visibly distinct (separator above + red text/badge). Untrack→`chezmoi forget` (source + `.myenv/` placement dropped, File STAYS on disk on EVERY environment; Default-tone `ConfirmDialog` whose copy says so — non-destructive, NOT styled red). Delete everywhere→`chezmoi destroy --force` (source + destination removed; Destructive-tone confirm that NAMES every affected environment via new `den:affected-environments` blast-radius query = envs subscribed to the File's Workspace, self first). Both commit LOCALLY (ADR 0006). `den:untrack`/`den:delete-everywhere`/`den:affected-environments` IPC + preload + Workspace wiring; `OperationKind` gains untrack/delete-everywhere; `MyenvStore.removePlacement`; `button.tsx` destructive/outline variants. **Caught + fixed a real bug while TDD-ing the seam**: forget/destroy *delete* the source-state file (`dot_zshrc`) but `untrackFile`/`deleteEverywhereFile` committed only `['.myenv','.chezmoiignore']`, leaving the deletion unstaged → the removed File stayed committed in the Remote and would re-appear on the next Sync. Switched both to `git.commitAll` so the deletion travels; proven by a cross-env clone test (env B clones a Den without the destroyed File). +4 DenService e2e tests (untrack keeps-on-disk, destroy removes-everywhere, deletion-travels, affectedEnvironments blast radius). 95 tests green. Unblocks nothing new (1-09 already grabbable).
2026-06-15 · CODE · ✅ Done · workflow · 1-07 fix (reviewer): the local status axis read the WRONG `chezmoi status` column. Per `chezmoi help status` (verified empirically against the bundled binary), column 1/X = last-written-vs-actual = the LOCAL edit; column 2/Y = actual-vs-target = what `apply` will do = the INCOMING axis (1-09). `parseChezmoiStatus` preferred Y, so a local delete (`DA`) mislabeled "added" and incoming-only rows (` M`/` A`, no local edit) leaked onto the local axis. Now reads **column X only** (no Y fallback): `DA`→deleted, ` M`/` A`/` R`→omitted (incoming, 1-09's job), `MM`→modified (unchanged). Rewrote the doc comment + unit-test spec to match chezmoi's documented columns; e2e fileTree (local `MM`→modified) still green. 91 tests green. Unblocks 1-09's Remote axis cleanly (no incoming collision on the local axis). Commit amended.
2026-06-15 · CODE · ✅ Done · workflow · 1-07 three-pane view: real chezmoi↔main↔IPC↔UI three-pane. NEW `den:tree`/`den:diff` IPC (read-only, _trace-asserted) over `DenService.fileTree` (managed Files + `parseChezmoiStatus` local axis M/A/D/R/U + `chezmoi ignored`→muted + `.myenv/` placement, all in one snapshot) and `fileDiff` (`chezmoi diff <file>`). New `ChezmoiAdapter.managed()`/`ignoredPaths()` + pure `chezmoi-status.ts` parser. Renderer Workspace rebuilt: @pierre/trees FileTree driven by setGitStatus + working search (⌘K) + inline rename + drag-reorganize + a no-op renderRowDecoration seam for the 1-09 Remote axis; @pierre/diffs PatchDiff of the selected File's real diff; inspector FILE info (Workspace/Scope/Path/Status) + incoming-callout seam (1-09). @pierre/* betas already pinned; pnpm-patched @pierre/trees to kill the `Math.random()` sticky-inset jitter; Shiki trimmed to dotden's config languages via a grammar-free `shiki` alias-shim (renderer build 308→93 chunks; wolfram/emacs-lisp/cpp/etc gone). Test hygiene: force `commit.gpgsign=false` in the temp-repo fixtures so host 1Password signing can't hang `git commit`. 90 tests green (8 status-parser + 1 fileTree/fileDiff e2e + tree/diff IpcBridge). Unblocks 1-08/1-09/1-14/2-01.

UI: OnboardingShell (rail + content slot + step router) + OnboardingMenu (6-step rail) + OBContent steps Welcome→CreateRepo→ConnectURL(reuses 1-03 preflight/connect)→Discover→Commit(Commit+Sync via 1-04)→AutoSync(wired opt-in slot, engine=1-12)→Done; ListRow scan rows; picks Track via 1-04 `den.track` → default Workspace auto-seeded (no org asked); App.tsx routes onboarding↔Workspace. 81 tests green (11 DiscoveryScanner + discover IPC). 2-07/2-08 dep satisfied (still need their other blockers).
