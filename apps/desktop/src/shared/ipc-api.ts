/**
 * Single source of truth for the `window.dotden` API contract.
 *
 * This is the ONE place the renderer↔main IPC surface is described. Both ends
 * are checked against it at compile time:
 * - the preload (`src/preload/index.ts`) annotates its exposed object as
 *   `const api: DotdenApi`, so the bridge is verified to *implement* the contract;
 * - the renderer (`src/renderer/vite-env.d.ts`) declares `Window.dotden` as
 *   `DotdenApi`, so app code is verified to *consume* the same contract.
 *
 * The result types are imported type-only from the foundation layer, so any
 * change to {@link PreflightResult}/{@link ConnectResult} becomes a renderer
 * COMPILE error instead of a silent runtime drift.
 *
 * The import is intentionally `import type` from a `.js`-suffixed specifier:
 * - it is erased at build time, so this file pulls **no** Electron/Node runtime
 *   into the renderer bundle (ADR 0023 — the foundation stays Electron-free, and
 *   the renderer never imports main-process runtime);
 * - the `.js` extension satisfies the main project's `NodeNext` resolution while
 *   the renderer's `Bundler` resolution accepts it too, so the single file
 *   typechecks under both `tsconfig.node.json` and `tsconfig.web.json`.
